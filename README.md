ABSTRACT
 
By introducing an Android-based Mobile Campus application for students, teachers, and parents, the project aims to improve the management of student information in educational institutions. The current means of informing students, like notice boards and websites, can be time-consuming and challenging to access. Through the use of encryption algorithms, the application will enable quicker and simpler communication, greater efficiency, and secure storage of sensitive data. Encryption is required to increase the security of sensitive information exchanged between apps and remote servers as well as to make it difficult to read and use sensitive information that is stored on devices.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Project Profile 
Our project is an application which is for students and will be run by students and faculty. In this project our objective is to deliver important information about college to students through an application android platform.
Name of our application is Regimen. Regimen means a planned routine of actions that you have to accomplish for something.
Our project is an attempt to provide the advantage to students by giving them information about everything they need about college. Our project will be serving all the details to the students that they need about college for example - important dates, notes, upcoming events, notices, previous year questions papers, Contact details of faculty and student council members, personal details of students like GPA and internal marks.
In this project we will be developing two applications one which will be admin based and other which will be user based.
Admin-based application is used to delete, edit and update the data for the user application which will be operated by authorised users only. Whereas user-based applications can be used by college people only to stay updated with college information.
 

Since the application will be available in the play store it can be easily downloaded and used by the college people. By simply putting credentials, applications can be accessed as per needs.

2.	PROBLEM FORMULATION
OBJECTIVES  
We aim:
1.	User friendly- 
An important goal that will be accomplished is making an app that is user-friendly for students. This goal will be accomplished due to various factors, including design, functionality, and usability. With the help of this app, we hope to give students access to a simple, effective platform that will improve their academic experience and facilitate learning.

2.	Updates easily-
With features like curated newsfeeds, customizable notifications, and straightforward search options, our application is made to be accessible and user-friendly. We hope to assist students in making informed decisions, keeping up with current affairs, and succeeding in their academic endeavours by giving them the most recent news and information.
3.	Information-
Our website is intended to be a one-stop resource for all things college-related. We offer a central location where students can access all the information they require to succeed, from academic schedules and course materials to campus activities and job openings.




SCOPE OF PROJECT 
Regimen is for: 
1.	For updates –
For college students who must balance their academic, social, and personal obligations in today's fast-paced world, staying informed and current is crucial. The goal of this project is to develop an app that will assist college students in staying up to date on all relevant college information, including class schedules, exam dates, extracurricular activities, campus events, and other significant announcements.
2.	For verified notes -  
Creating a database of notes from various sources, including college professors, subject matter experts, and verified students, are a key component of the project. The platform or application can then give students organised, user-friendly access to these notes. Students can easily find the information they need by sorting the notes based on subject, topic, and degree of difficulty.
3.	For connection –
Connecting with faculty members, advisors, and administrative staff members can be difficult for students in many colleges. The goal of this project is to develop a platform or application that enables easy communication between college staff and students.


FEASIBILITY STUDY 
 Several crucial factors would be taken into consideration during the feasibility study for putting into place an application that keeps students informed about college seminars, upcoming events, notes, and other things related to their college. It would be crucial to assess the requirements and needs of the target audience, in this case, students. 
 
The success of the application will depend on how well it meets the needs and expectations of the students. You can ask students what features they would like to see in the application through a survey or focus group. The project's technical viability would need to be evaluated. Technical know-how, resources for hardware and software, and a safe database to keep student data would all be needed for the development of the application.

 The system's compatibility, scalability, and available technology should all be taken into account in the feasibility study. To determine the costs associated with creating, implementing, and maintaining the application. Hardware, software, development, training, and on going support would all fall under this category. The study ought to assess the application's capacity for generating income.
